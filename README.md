# INST UWB Positioning Visualizer

## üö® About the INST Project

**INST (Instantly Networked Smart Triage)** is a revolutionary emergency response system designed to save lives during Mass Casualty Incidents (MCIs). Developed with funding from the European Space Agency (ESA) and UK Space Agency (UKSA) through the Business Applications and Space Solutions Programme (BASS), INST addresses critical coordination failures that have cost lives in major emergencies.

### The Problem INST Solves

The 2017 Manchester Arena bombing tragically highlighted coordination failures between emergency services that cost precious lives. The public inquiry identified that **lack of real-time coordination between police, ambulance services, and fire departments significantly impacted response effectiveness**. INST was created to ensure such coordination failures never happen again.

### How INST Works

INST is a **satellite-enabled emergency response system** that provides real-time situational awareness through:

- **Low-cost, lightweight devices** that can be quickly attached to or placed on casualties
- **Satellite communication networks** enabling coverage even when terrestrial infrastructure fails
- **Real-time position tracking** showing exactly where each casualty is located
- **Medical urgency indicators** helping responders prioritize treatment
- **Live casualty counting** providing accurate incident scale assessment

> *"If INST can save just one life, then it will be worth it."* - Joseph Spear, Director of Communications

## üéØ UWB Positioning: The Foundation of Real-Time Tracking

### What is Ultra-Wideband (UWB)?

Ultra-Wideband technology forms the **precision positioning backbone** of the INST system. UWB provides:

- **Centimeter-level accuracy** for indoor and outdoor positioning
- **Low power consumption** essential for emergency device longevity  
- **Penetration through obstacles** maintaining signal in debris/structural damage
- **Minimal interference** with other emergency communication systems
- **Real-time performance** with microsecond timing precision

### UWB in Emergency Response Context

In Mass Casualty Incidents, **knowing exactly where each casualty is located can mean the difference between life and death**. The UWB positioning system enables:

#### üè• **Triage Optimization**
- **Spatial triage mapping** - visualize casualty distribution across incident zones
- **Priority routing** - direct responders to most critical casualties first
- **Resource allocation** - deploy medical teams based on real casualty density

#### üöë **Coordinated Response** 
- **Unified situational picture** - all emergency services see the same real-time data
- **Avoid duplication** - prevent multiple teams responding to same casualty
- **Coverage gaps** - identify areas that may have been missed

#### üìç **Precision in Chaos**
- **GPS-denied environments** - works inside collapsed buildings, underground
- **Debris navigation** - track casualties even when landmarks are destroyed
- **Night operations** - position tracking independent of visibility

## üñ•Ô∏è The UWB Visualizer Interface

This application provides a **real-time command center view** for emergency coordinators, displaying:

### Core Visualization Features

- **Live Node Tracking** - Real-time positions of all INST devices
- **Distance Measurements** - Precise spacing between casualties and responders  
- **Gateway Networks** - Infrastructure nodes maintaining communication
- **Physics-Based Layout** - Intuitive spatial relationships with configurable dynamics
- **Mobile Responsiveness** - Operates on tablets and smartphones in field conditions

### Emergency Operations Interface

- **MQTT Integration** - Real-time data streaming from satellite/terrestrial networks
- **Scalable Display** - From single casualties to 100+ victim scenarios
- **Status Monitoring** - Connection health and device battery levels
- **Console Logging** - Complete audit trail of all system events
- **Maximized Views** - Full-screen tactical displays for incident command

### Data Flow in Emergency Scenarios

1. **INST devices** attached to casualties transmit position via UWB
2. **UWB anchor networks** triangulate precise positions  
3. **Satellite uplinks** relay data when terrestrial networks are damaged
4. **MQTT message broker** (`mqtt.dynamicdevices.co.uk`) distributes real-time updates
5. **Visualization interface** provides live tactical picture to incident commanders

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### For Emergency Response Coordinators

1. **Open the visualizer** - Load `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. **Connect to INST network** - Click "Connect MQTT" (pre-configured for INST systems)
3. **Monitor live positions** - Casualties and responders appear as they come online
4. **Adjust view settings** - Use physics controls to optimize display for your scenario
5. **Full-screen when needed** - Click "Maximize" for incident command displays

### For Technical Operators

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DynamicDevices/inst-visualiser.git
cd inst-visualiser

# Open in browser (no build process required)
open index.html

# Or serve via web server for networked access
python -m http.server 8000
```

### Configuration

The system connects to the INST production network by default:

- **MQTT Broker**: `mqtt.dynamicdevices.co.uk:8083`
- **Data Topic**: `uwb/positions`
- **Protocol**: WebSocket-based MQTT for web browser compatibility

## üîß Technical Specifications

### Browser Requirements
- **Modern JavaScript support** (ES6+)
- **WebSocket capability** for real-time MQTT
- **Canvas/SVG rendering** for position visualization
- **Mobile touch support** for field tablet use

### Performance Characteristics
- **Zero external dependencies** - works offline after initial load
- **Real-time updates** - <100ms position update latency
