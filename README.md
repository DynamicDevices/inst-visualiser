## üö® About the INST Project

**INST (Instantly Networked Smart Triage)** is a revolutionary emergency response system designed to save lives during Mass Casualty Incidents (MCIs). Developed with funding from the **European Space Agency (ESA)** and **UK Space Agency (UKSA)** through the Business Applications and Space Solutions Programme (BASS), INST addresses critical coordination failures that have cost lives in major emergencies.

### The Problem INST Solves

The 2017 Manchester Arena bombing tragically highlighted coordination failures between emergency services that cost precious lives. The public inquiry identified that **lack of real-time coordination between police, ambulance services, and fire departments significantly impacted response effectiveness**. INST was created to ensure such coordination failures never happen again.

### How INST Works

INST is a **satellite-enabled emergency response system** that provides real-time situational awareness through:

- **Low-cost, lightweight devices** that can be quickly attached to or placed on casualties
- **Satellite communication networks** enabling coverage even when terrestrial infrastructure fails
- **Real-time position tracking** showing exactly where each casualty is located
- **Medical urgency indicators** helping responders prioritise treatment
- **Live casualty counting** providing accurate incident scale assessment

> *"If INST can save just one life, then it will be worth it."* - Joseph Spear, Director of Communications

## üéØ UWB Positioning: The Foundation of Real-Time Tracking

### What is Ultra-Wideband (UWB)?

Ultra-Wideband technology forms the **precision positioning backbone** of the INST system. UWB provides:

- **Centimetre-level accuracy** for indoor and outdoor positioning
- **Low power consumption** essential for emergency device longevity  
- **Penetration through obstacles** maintaining signal in debris/structural damage
- **Minimal interference** with other emergency communication systems
- **Real-time performance** with microsecond timing precision

### UWB in Emergency Response Context

In Mass Casualty Incidents, **knowing exactly where each casualty is located can mean the difference between life and death**. The UWB positioning system enables:

#### üè• **Triage Optimisation**
- **Spatial triage mapping** - visualise casualty distribution across incident zones
- **Priority routing** - direct responders to most critical casualties first
- **Resource allocation** - deploy medical teams based on real casualty density

#### üöë **Coordinated Response** 
- **Unified situational picture** - all emergency services see the same real-time data
- **Avoid duplication** - prevent multiple teams responding to same casualty
- **Coverage gaps** - identify areas that may have been missed

#### üìç **Precision in Chaos**
- **GPS-denied environments** - works inside collapsed buildings, underground
- **Debris navigation** - track casualties even when landmarks are destroyed
- **Night operations** - position tracking independent of visibility

## üì± Mobile-First Crisis Interface (v3.3)

The visualiser is now optimised for crisis response operations with a **touch-friendly, field-ready interface**:

üéØ **Crisis Operations UX:**
