## 🚨 About the INST Project

**INST (Instantly Networked Smart Triage)** is a professional positioning system designed for emergency response applications. Developed with funding from the **European Space Agency (ESA)** and **UK Space Agency (UKSA)** through the Business Applications and Space Solutions Programme (BASS), INST addresses positioning and coordination challenges in various operational environments.

### The Technology INST Provides

The 2017 Manchester Arena incident highlighted coordination challenges between emergency services. The public inquiry identified that **better real-time coordination between police, ambulance services, and fire departments would have improved response effectiveness**. INST was created to address these coordination needs.

### How INST Works

INST is a **satellite-enabled positioning system** that provides real-time situational awareness through:

- **Low-cost, lightweight devices** that can be quickly deployed for positioning
- **Satellite communication networks** enabling coverage even when terrestrial infrastructure fails
- **Real-time position tracking** showing exactly where each tracked item is located
- **Status indicators** helping operators prioritise response activities
- **Live monitoring** providing accurate operational scale assessment

> *"Precision positioning technology made simple."* - Joseph Spear, Director of Communications

## 🎯 UWB Positioning: The Foundation of Real-Time Tracking

### What is Ultra-Wideband (UWB)?

Ultra-Wideband technology forms the **precision positioning backbone** of the INST system. UWB provides:

- **Centimetre-level accuracy** for indoor and outdoor positioning
- **Low power consumption** essential for extended device operation
- **Penetration through obstacles** maintaining signal in challenging environments
- **Minimal interference** with other communication systems
- **Real-time performance** with microsecond timing precision

### UWB in Professional Applications

In professional positioning applications, **knowing exactly where each element is located provides significant operational advantages**. The UWB positioning system enables:

#### 🏥 **Professional Monitoring**
- **Spatial mapping** - visualise distribution of tracked elements across operational zones
- **Priority routing** - direct personnel to most important locations first
- **Resource allocation** - deploy teams based on real positioning data

#### 🚑 **Coordinated Operations** 
- **Unified situational picture** - all teams see the same real-time data
- **Avoid duplication** - prevent multiple teams responding to same location
- **Coverage gaps** - identify areas that may have been missed

#### 📍 **Precision in Complex Environments**
- **GPS-denied environments** - works inside buildings, underground locations
- **Obstacle navigation** - track positions even when landmarks are obscured
- **24/7 operations** - position tracking independent of visibility conditions
